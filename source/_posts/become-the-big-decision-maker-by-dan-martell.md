Recently, I found a fact which is I was a totally different person with my co-worker, especially in the "Big Decision" I thought. I have the idea about the LEAN spirit, try quickly and fail quickly. But I can't try it without any research or information. For me, it's like a blind walk into street.

I prefer to define the testing goals, how to test, and how can I evaluate the testing result. I will not test if I don't have enough information. The video I watched today help me to figure out how to make the decision objectively.

1.  Define the problem - figure out what's the specific problem behind it
2.  Research the solution space - use google image to search visual framework about your solution
3.  Connect with your mentor - ask the mentor which you want to be
4.  Verify with your peers - confirm the decision with your partner or co-worker
5.  Decide and Adjust - wrong decisions is better than no decisions

Use the JFDI ( Just F\*\*king Do It! ) if you still can't make the decisions after above steps.
